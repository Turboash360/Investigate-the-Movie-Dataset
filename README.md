# 1. Introduction
In this project I am going to determine how the movie's voting average differs according to the movie genres, runtime, popularity and release year.
1. Which Genres have the highest voting average?
2. How does the movie duration affect the voting average?
3. How does the release year correlate with the voting average?
4. What is the correlation between popularity and voting average?
